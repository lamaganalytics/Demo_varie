# Shiny Demo Apps and Multivariate Analysis Report


This repository contains three main files demonstrating interactive analyses and predictive modeling:

- Morphological KPI Shiny (App.R)
An online Shiny application for monitoring and controlling the morphology of foam during the production process.

- Ostwald Parameters & Viscosity Shiny App (Viscosity_melt_demo)
An online Shiny application to estimate Ostwald parameters and viscosity from extrusion process data.

- Multivariate Analysis Report (LASSO_report_demo PDF)
A demonstration report showing how to extract multivariate correlations between input and output variables using LASSO regression, including predicted vs. real value plots and model evaluation metrics.

These resources are intended to showcase interactive process monitoring and predictive modeling workflows using Shiny and R.
